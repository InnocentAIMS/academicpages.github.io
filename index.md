## Welcome

I am a mathematician with strong foundations and interest in interdisciplinary research. My passion lies in advancing and applying mathematical tools to solve real-world problems, particularly in:

- **Computational Neuroscience**
- **Machine Learning Theory**
- **Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases**
- **Dynamical Systems & Optimization**

Currently, I am:
- Pursuing Master's research on gradient descent dynamics in neural networks at AIMS Senegal
- Participating in Erasmus+ exchange at University of Crete, Greece
- Member of the Ecology Meets Infectious Diseases (EMID) research community at AIM
- Serving as Teaching Assistant in DR Congo
